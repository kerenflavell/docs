# Supervisor — the **quality-control lead**

**Slot in the hierarchy**

- **Priority level 2** (between Assistants ⇡ and Directors ⇣)
- **Memory read scope:** bands **0.0 – 1.79**
  - Assistant operational data
  - Supervisor-only band
- **Write priority:** **1.2** → their notes land in a band Directors can read

### Mission & focus

- **Thread-level quality control** — watch live conversations/tasks
- **Performance monitoring** — collect metrics, flag drift or errors
- **Intervention management** — step in (or escalate) when standards slip
- **Configurable review interval** — e.g. “audit every 5 messages”

### Powers & tooling

| Capability                          | Detail                                                             |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised characters list**      | Targets specific Assistants/Executors to watch                     |
| **Prompt editing (optional)**       | Can tweak system prompts of subordinates if the setting is enabled |
| **Connection Monitor integration**  | Auto-escalates issues to Supervisor with custom instructions       |
| **Escalation target**               | Directors can list a Supervisor in monitor configs                 |
| **Observer in Autothink workflows** | Joins as a non-blocking node to inspect reasoning                  |
| **M2M communication**               | Talks to other agents for coordinated oversight                    |

# Director (“Meta Coordinator”) at a glance

**Position in the MetaLayers hierarchy**

- Priority level **3**
- Sits **between** Supervisors (level 2) and Seers (level 4)
- Works with memory bands **0.0 – 1.99**
- Writes to the **“Director Coordination”** band with priority **1.8**

### What Directors do

- **Bridge strategy and execution**
  - Translate high-level Seer objectives into day-to-day directions
  - Oversee several Supervisor teams to keep work aligned
- **Department-level coordination**
  - Allocate resources across multiple projects
  - Ensure consistent operational standards
- **Primary escalation point** for Supervisors needing broader guidance

### Visibility & limits

| Can **read**        | Cannot **read**                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Assistant memories  | Deep Memory (long-term history)    |
| Executor memories   | Seer Insights (strategic analysis) |
| Supervisor memories |                                    |

### Prompt-writing powers

- May **modify system prompts** for **Assistants** and **Supervisors**
- **Cannot** alter Seer configurations (protected by hierarchy)

### Memory allocation (per Director)

| Memory band           | Slots  |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| Assistant             | **20** |
| Supervisor            | **15** |
| Director Coordination | **8**  |

### What Directors **don’t** have

- Access to the **14 autonomous thinking strategies** reserved for Seers
- Direct strategic analysis duties—focus stays on **operational coordination**

### Why the role matters

> Directors supply the **operational leadership** that lets an AI organization scale from individual task management to true cross-departmental collaboration.

- Coordinate **multi-team projects** and **cross-department initiatives**
- Maintain **quality and consistency** while executing Seer-level strategies
- Provide a clear chain of command, keeping operations agile and aligned

# Executor — the **on-demand specialist**

**Where the Executor sits**

- **Priority level 0** — lowest tier in the MetaLayers stack
- Spawned _only_ by an Assistant; disappears automatically (no manual config)
- Writes at **priority 0.1** to keep temporary output from polluting main memories

### Why & when they exist

> Executors let an Assistant break a big job into laser-focused subtasks **without spawning permanent agents**.

- Handle **specialized research**, **repetitive processing**, or any one-off chunk of work
- Free up the parent Assistant to stay responsive to the user
- Auto-clean after **1 h** (if finished) or **24 h** (hard timeout) to save resources

### Creation & inheritance flow

| Step                                            | What happens                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Assistant calls **ExecutorService.create()** | Generates a unique ID \+ metadata                                                                |
| 2. **Inheritance**                              | Copies provider, model, memory quotas, M2M settings from Assistant                               |
| 3. **Restrictions applied**                     | Lowers write priority to 0.1, disables supervision & terminal access, strips autonomous thinking |
| 4. **Custom system prompt**                     | States task scope, temporary nature, collaboration rules                                         |
| 5. Monitoring endpoints                         | `/status`, `/complete`, `/cleanup` keep lifecycle transparent                                    |

### Capabilities & boundaries

| Can **do**                                    | Cannot **do**                             |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Read memories in band 0.0 – 0.99              | Access higher-level memories              |
| Run the same model/provider as parent         | Supervise or spawn other characters       |
| Participate in Autothink **canvas** workflows | Use full Autothink strategy set           |
| Support every node type (task, API, etc.)     | Modify its own config beyond prompt-scope |
| Collaborate with creating Assistant via M2M   | Access terminal (disabled by default)     |

### Memory snapshot

| Band                     | Read | Write            |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :--------------- |
| 0.0 – 0.99 (Operational) | ✔    | ✔ (priority 0.1) |
| Higher bands             | ✘    | ✘                |

### Lifecycle at a glance

1. **Spawn → work → mark complete** (Assistant or API)
2. **Auto-cleanup**
   - **1 h** after completion, or
   - **24 h** after creation, even if unfinished

### Why Executors matter

- **Scales** complex workflows without character bloat
- **Isolates** experimental or heavy tasks from core memories
- **Maintains** resource efficiency through strict time-boxed lifetimes

> In short, Executors are the disposable “task pods” that give Qui Studio elastic power while keeping the hierarchy tidy and predictable.

# Assistant — the **front-line performer**

**Where the Assistant sits**

- **Priority level:** operates in memory band **0.0 – 0.99**
- **Write priority:** **0.5** (keeps their output in the “Operational” layer)
- **Hierarchy:**
  - Reports _up_ to Supervisors → Directors → Seers
  - Can spawn _down_ to temporary **Executors** for sub-tasks

### Core responsibilities

- **Direct user interaction** — chat, Q&A, support
- **Immediate task execution** — content creation, code snippets, research
- **Problem-solving** with basic reasoning strategies (analytical, sequential, comparative)
- **Delegation** — can create Executor characters to handle focused sub-tasks

### Visibility & boundaries

| Can **read / write**              | Cannot touch                              |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Operational memories (0.0 – 0.99) | Supervisor, Director, Seer memories       |
| Own thinking strategies (basic)   | Deep strategic toolset reserved for Seers |

### Technical super-powers

- **Executor creation** — spins up single-purpose workers, then retires them
- **Model-to-model (M2M) communication** — coordinates with other AI agents
- **Optional terminal access** — run commands for dev workflows
- **Smart prompt compilation** — merges personality, memories, and task guides into one optimized prompt for either Anthropic or OpenAI back-ends

### Memory footprint (typical defaults)

| Band                  | Slots                                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Assistant Operational | _Configurable_ (balanced to keep context focused) |

### What the Assistant **is not**

- Doesn’t perform **strategic analysis** (Seer territory)
- Doesn’t enforce **quality control** across threads (Supervisor job)

### Why Assistants matter

> They are the **primary entry point** for users—powerful enough to solve problems independently, yet scoped tightly enough to stay safe and predictable.

- Ideal for **chat-based help**, **content generation**, **light coding**, and **research**
- Provide the **versatile backbone** that lets Qui Studio scale: upstream roles guide strategy and quality, while Assistants execute quickly and delegate when depth is needed.

# Seer— the **strategic brain**

**Place in the hierarchy**

- **Priority band:** **4.0 – 4.99** (highest operational tier)
- Oversees Directors → Supervisors → Assistants → Executors
- Acts as the **analytical anchor** for multi-agent workflows

### Signature capability — **Autothink Strategy System**

> Seers alone unlock 14 thinking strategies that turn raw data into deep insight.

| Level        | Sample strategies                                                  | What they’re for                                                   |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**    | Pattern recognition · Causal analysis · Scenario planning          | Spot trends, map cause-effect chains, model “what-ifs”             |
| **Advanced** | Meta-cognitive reflection · Critical thinking · Strategy synthesis | Assess their own reasoning, challenge assumptions, combine tactics |

### Core responsibilities

- **Strategic reasoning** — craft plans, diagnose complex problems, optimize workflows
- **Deep analysis** — apply pattern recognition to streaming data, run decision-tree scenarios
- **Workflow optimization** — reflect on outcomes, adjust prompts or parameters to improve overall system performance

### Technical privileges & tooling

- **“🤔 AutoThink” tab** in the Character Modal — lets users pick any of the 14 strategies
- **Autothink Instruction Builder & Processor** — generate dynamic, strategy-specific prompts on the fly
- **Role-agnostic backend** — Seer logic plugs into the same infrastructure as other characters, but with elevated memory and UI rights

### Memory & context

| Resource              | Seer default                                                |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priority band**     | 4.0 – 4.99                                                  |
| **Memory allocation** | Enlarged (exact slots configurable per project)             |
| **Read scope**        | All lower bands (Director, Supervisor, Assistant, Executor) |
| **Write scope**       | High-priority “Seer Insights” band                          |

### What Seers **are not**

- They **don’t** handle routine task execution — that’s for Assistants/Executors
- They **don’t** modify low-level prompts unless it aligns with strategic goals; operational tuning is left to Directors/Supervisors

### Why Seers matter

> When a workflow demands **big-picture vision plus rigorous analysis**, the Seer turns isolated tasks into a coherent, data-driven strategy.

- Ideal for **complex decision trees, long-horizon planning, cross-department analytics**
- Provide the **deep thinking layer** that keeps the entire MetaLayers ecosystem aligned with organizational objectives
