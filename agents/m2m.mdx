# M2M  — Quick Overview

**Core idea**

- Characters talk to each other with simple `@CharacterName` mentions.
- The mention triggers an immediate, structured message so the target can reply.
- Result: natural multi-agent conversations that split work across specialist AIs.

#### How it works under the hood

**1. Mention detection**

- Every message runs through `M2MResponseHandler`.
- Regex `@[\w\-]+` finds mentions, then resolves them (case-insensitive) against active characters.

**2. Message routing**

- System wraps the content as

  ```
  MESSAGE FROM <SourceName>
  <original text>
  
  ```

  and delivers it via **WebSockets** for real-time exchange.

**3. Safety & control**

- **Rate-limit:** default 10 msgs / 10 min per character.
- **Depth-limit:** chains stop after 3 hops to avoid loops.
- **Permissions:** `can_initiate`, `can_be_target` flags; self-mentions are blocked.
- **Kill-switch:** an emergency interrupt halts all M2M traffic in the session.

#### Why M2M matters

| Benefit                               | What it looks like in practice                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collaborative problem-solving**     | `@Researcher` gathers data → `@Analyst` interprets → `@Writer` drafts report — all without user micro-managing.                           |
| **Dynamic, conversational workflows** | Characters decide _when_ and _who_ to pull in, adapting on the fly instead of following rigid pipelines.                                  |
| **Role-based expertise integration**  | Assistants ping Supervisors for QA; Directors coordinate teams; Seers inject strategic guidance — each role stays within its permissions. |
| **Transparent teamwork for users**    | Every cross-talk is visible, so users watch the “AI team” collaborate and can step in at any point.                                       |
| **Scalable architecture**             | Add a new character and it’s instantly reachable by `@mention`; rate/permission guards keep scale from turning into chaos.                |

> **In short:** M2M turns isolated assistants into a coordinated **AI workforce**—powerful, flexible, and safe—using nothing more than conversational mentions.
