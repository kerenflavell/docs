# Key Workflow Nodes in Qui Studio

| Node                   | What it does                                                  | Key options / safeguards                                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start**              | Entry-point that seeds the first context and fires the chain. | Output-only; legacy 619-line block.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Loop**               | Re-runs a branch.                                             | • **Count**: 1-100 × • **Condition**: AI exit test• **Data-driven**: iterate a list• **Improve-until**: quality ≥ X— Max-iter, timeout, resource watch, emergency stop. |
| **Connection Monitor** | Oversees agent-to-agent chatter.                              | Observer handle, live metrics, loop detection, auto-escalate up the hierarchy, warning thresholds.                                                                      |

#### Architecture highlights

- **Handles:** input ▸, output ◂, bidirectional ↔, observer 👁️ — 14 px grab-points with live validation.
- **M2M-ready:** every node can pass messages that respect role permissions.
- **MetaLayers-aware:** node behaviour and memory access automatically adapt to the character roles (Assistant → Seer).
- **Modular:** \> 15 node types, each pluggable for custom extensions.

> **Bottom line:** these nodes let you build anything from a simple request-response chain to a fully supervised, multi-agent, strategy-driven workflow—without losing control over loops, quality, or resources.
