**Qui Studio** is a visual AI-workflow platform that turns isolated chatbots into a full-fledged **AI operating system**. Multiple characters—each with their own role, memory, and security guard-rails—work together through drag-and-drop workflows to solve complex problems.

### Think of Qui Studio as…

| Analogy                                 | What it means                                                       |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mission Control for AI**              | Coordinate a fleet of agents like air-traffic control.              |
| **Visual programming for intelligence** | Build logic by wiring nodes and characters—no code needed.          |
| **Enterprise AI automation**            | Scale intelligent processes across teams and departments.           |
| **Collaborative AI platform**           | Watch characters collaborate in real time right in the chat window. |

### Core capabilities

🎭 **Multiple AI characters**\
Create Seers for strategy, Directors for coordination, Supervisors for QA, Assistants for interaction, and Executors for task bursts—each with its own permissions.

🔗 **Visual workflow builder**\
AutoThink Canvas lets you connect characters and 15 \+ nodes in minutes.

🧠 **Advanced reasoning**\
The 7 × 7 framework gives agents 14 human-like thinking strategies.

🛡️ **Enterprise-grade security**\
Bank-level encryption, granular role permissions, secured terminal/web access, and deep monitoring keep everything safe and auditable.

### Where Qui Studio shines

- **Business process automation** – content pipelines, research cycles, decision hubs.
- **Research & analysis** – multiple AI researchers collaborate and synthesise findings.
- **Software development** – code review, testing, docs, deployment with secure terminal access.
- **Strategic planning** – Seer characters analyse markets, run scenarios, and advise leadership.

### Pro tips

- **Start simple** – one or two characters, basic flows.
- **Match role to task** – Seer ≠ Assistant; use the hierarchy wisely.
- **Monitor early, optimise often** – dashboards reveal performance and cost hot-spots.
- **Use the permission model** – security settings double as capability tuning.
