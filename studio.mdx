# Complete Interface Overview

### Chat Area — _your communication hub_

The Chat Area is mission control for every AI conversation in **Qui Studio**.

**Core purposes**

- **Multi-agent orchestration** – talk to several characters at once
- **Real-time collaboration** – watch agents think together live
- **Persistent context** – rich history with memory recall
- **Workflow links** – jump from chat straight into AutoThink Canvas

**Thread manager**

| What you can do      | Why it helps                             |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Run parallel threads | Keep projects or topics separate         |
| Drag-to-reorder      | Prioritise urgent chats                  |
| Per-thread models    | Tune each conversation’s AI mix          |
| Context isolation    | No spill-over unless you connect threads |

**Routing options**

- **Direct** – `@Analyst` gets the question
- **Broadcast** – send to many for brainstorms
- **Hierarchical** – message climbs Seer → Director → … Assistant
- **Round-robin** – each character replies in turn
- **Smart** – Qui Studio chooses the best character automatically

**Real-time features**

- Live streaming with _Stop_ button
- `@mentions` between characters
- Drag-and-drop file uploads with auto-processing
- Priority queue so time-critical messages jump the line

**Advanced chat controls**

| Control             | Use-case                                               |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edit / retry**    | Refine a prompt or regenerate an answer                |
| **Branch**          | Explore “what-if” paths without losing the main thread |
| **Export / import** | Save or reload entire conversations                    |
| **Snapshots**       | Bookmark key decision points                           |

### Statistics & Analytics

Memory usage, compression efficiency, token spend, character performance, budget alerts – all exportable to CSV.

### Character Cleanup & Backup

Detect inactive agents, bulk archive or delete (with dependency checks), automatic backups and version history.

### Emergency Stop
